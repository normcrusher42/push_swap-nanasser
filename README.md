# Push_swap

## finished in 5 days, failed an exam, explained poorly, and left home feeling drunk.
## this is just not my week chat.

HUGE thanks to my colleagues in 42 for helping me find silly edge cases I hadn't cover right before submitting ma homies are the best <3
(and one colleague in particular who taught me about clearing git cache) this project was terrifying enough I need ma sleep

feel free to squeeze the project as much as you can for bugs. None of my evaluators could and they weren't all cutsie.

*ðŸŽµ whoever can push, and swap through code, and sort through some linked lists cleaaanly, will look like the king, sit down like the goat, 100% as he's pleaaaased ðŸŽµ*
**where is he??? where is the man who can bring a segfault- wooo-woaaah~**

*screw this sorting program, we've been here for hours, none of us can sort this, we got no brain power. Screw this damn challenge, no more re makes, can't you guys see our function's failed??*

- A very EPIC reference
